Description: CoronaNetR is a database on government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
    To date, this dataset provides the most comprehensive and granular 
    documentation of such government policies in the world, capturing data for 
    20 broad policy categories alongside many other dimensions, including the 
    initiator, target, and timing of a policy. This package is a programmatic 
    front-end to up-to-date CoronaNet data.
